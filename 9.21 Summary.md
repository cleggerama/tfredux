Topics
Mission Briefing/Drug Party at Ambassador Nor's Apartment
Took place in a luxurious penthouse on Absalom Station
Ambassador Nor offered the party various drugs and refreshments
First Speaker Elsibo briefed the team on their mission to Ice Front
The mission involves finding clues about relics and people who escaped the Omega Zone
Quid, Dundee, and Jasper stayed to party all night with the Ambassador
Quid passed out almost immediately, but Dundee and Jasper took some serious drugs with Nor and ended up gaining Wisdom but losing Intelligence

Serena and Otavi Bond Before Encountering “The Sniffer"
Serena and Otavi went to a high-end sweets shop where Otavi told Serena about the death of his parents and the facility that trained him
The two of them had an encounter with “The Sniffer” but he disappeared before they could even see him

Quid Researches Frozen Trove
Quid does reasearch about Frozen Trove
Triaxian mega-corp.
Focused on genetic modifications for commercial and industrial use. 
Its scientists are considered among the best in the business.
Working for frozen trove is considered a prestigious and lucrative scientific career. 
EJ Corp tried multiple times to acquire Frozen Trove Labs and has been so far unsuccessful.
The corporation's CEO is an old, white dragon. 
Frozen Trove is actually under investigation by several ethics groups, but so far, the company's legal team has insulated them from any formal charges or scandals. Erilidio is known to be one of those CEOs that quickly cuts loose any potential problems in his corporation, which often encourages cutthroat and desperate actions amongst employees. There are several interviews in which he basically suggests that competition is good, not just between firms, but inside the firm as well, suggesting that he is a real to work for, like that father that wants each of his children to think to worry that daddy might love the other one more.
Starship Combat
En route to Ice Front, the party's ship was attacked by an unknown alien vessel
The enemy ship sent taunting messages, calling the party "cockroaches"
The party successfully defended themselves, using various tactics and roles:
Jasper as Magic Officer
Otavi as Pilot
Serena as Captain
Dundee as Gunner
Quid as Engineer
They disabled the enemy ship, which self-destructed when they tried to dock with it
Winter Harvest Research Facility
Run by Dr. Monsylkis, a Verthani scientist
Staff includes Spinjack (chief technician) and Farvenzi (head of security)
Facility has advanced biogenetic capabilities and climate control technology
Uses a large scaffold tower to maintain artificially cold conditions
Likely a front for Frozen Trove Labs, a genetics concern
Staff were evasive about their research and reluctant to share information
Planet Exploration
Party hiked east from the facility to find Izalgunn settlement
Discovered cleared paths suitable for vehicles, contrary to what facility staff claimed
Noticed signs of large grazing creatures in the forest, with trees stripped of foliage up to 40 feet high
No small animals or birds were observed during the trek
Native Izalgunn Creatures
Four-armed, bipedal humanoids with silver-gray skin and green markings
Described as "centaur-like" by facility workers
Apparently primitive/tribal level of development
Live in settlements to the east of the Winter Harvest facility
Next Steps
Continue exploring the planet and investigating the Izalgunns
Determine if Izalgunns are connected to the artifacts from the Omega Zone
Be wary of Winter Harvest/Frozen Trove's true motives and activities
Investigate the large giraffe-like creatures attacking the Izalgunns
The next game session is scheduled for the 27th at 9:30 PM
